<body class="focus-tail"><h1 class="" operator="" id="modes">Modes</h1><p>Neomacs use modes to provide functionalities to buffers. Neomacs modes are <i>mixins</i>, i.e. CLOS classes that can be dynamically added to buffers. A Neomacs buffer always inherit from zero or more modes and the <code>buffer</code> class.</p><dl><dt>Class: <code>mode</code> inherits <code>(standard-class)</code></dt><dd>Metaclass for modes.</dd><dd><dl><dt>Slot: <code>commands</code></dt><dt>Slot: <code>keymap</code></dt><dt>Slot: <code>lighter</code><dd>String displayed in header to indicate this mode is enabled.</dd></dt><dt>Slot: <code>hooks</code><dd>Other modes to enable or disable when enable or disabling this mode.</dd></dt></dl></dd></dl><p>Mixins mostly supersede buffer-local variables and hooks used in previous editors like Emacs and Hemlock. Modes can have slots, which are introduced to the buffers that enable them. Methods that specialize on a mode customize behavior of generic functions on buffers. Many generic functions (e.g. <code>on-*</code>) in Neomacs has a buffer as the first argument, which is suitable for specializing on modes. Many ordinary functions in Neomacs has a backing generic function which has a buffer as first argument, usually with name <code>*-aux</code>.</p><h2 id="toggling-modes">Toggling modes</h2><dl><dt>Function: <code>enable</code> <code>(mode-name)</code></dt><dd>Enable the mode named by MODE-NAME in current buffer.</dd><dt>Function: <code>disable</code> <code>(mode-name)</code></dt><dd>Disable the mode named by MODE-NAME in current buffer.</dd><dd>This also disables any modes that has MODE-NAME as super-mode.</dd><dt>Function: <code>toggle</code> <code>(mode-name)</code></dt><dd>Toggle the mode named by MODE-NAME in current buffer.</dd><dd>This disables MODE-NAME either if it is enabled directly or via
dependency (in which case all dependents are also disabled), and
enables it otherwise.</dd></dl><p>Mode toggling hooks:</p><dl><dt>Standard generic function: <code>enable-aux</code> <code>(mode-name)</code></dt><dd>Run after MODE-NAME is enabled.</dd><dd>This generic function is run with <code>current-buffer</code> bound to the buffer

Suppose mode A has mode B in its <code>hooks</code> and mode C as its super-mode, note the differences:</p><ul><li operator=""> Mode B (in mode hooks) can be disabled or enabled again independently from mode A, while disabling mode C (as super-mode) also disables mode A</li><li>Code for enabling mode B (in mode hooks) runs after mode A, while code for enabling mode C (as super-mode) runs before mode A</li></ul><p>Thefore, super-modes are best used for expressing dependencies between modes (e.g. <code>minibuffer-completion-mode</code> has <code>minibuffer-mode</code> as a super-mode), and mode hooks are best used for suggesting using some other modes together with a mode (e.g. <code>prog-mode</code> has <code>undo-mode</code> in its mode hooks by default).</p><h2 id="defining-modes">Defining modes</h2><dl><dt>Macro: <code>define-mode</code> <code>(name super-modes slots &amp;rest options)</code></dt><dd>Define a mode with NAME.</dd><dd>Like <code>define-class</code> besides supporting extra OPTIONS:</dd><dd>(:toggler TOGGLER-P): If TOGGLER-P is t, generate a toggler command
